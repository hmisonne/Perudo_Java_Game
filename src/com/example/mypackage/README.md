# Perudo Game in Java

Perudo is one of my favorite game to play with friends.
The rules are easy to understand, and there is just the right amount of strategy and fun! 

For this project, I decided to use the Java Programming language and applied the principles of Object Oriented Programming. 

## Quick Overview of the game
The original game is played with opaque cups and dice.
At the beginning of the game, players receive 1 cup and 5 dice each. After shuffling dice inside the cups, players flip their cup (with the dice inside).
Then each player must make a bet on how many dice there is on the table one after the other. Each player can only see his/her dice and must decide to make a higher bet or call the last player a liar!

If a player makes a wrong bet and get caught then he looses a die! If he no longer has a die, then he is out of the game.
The winner is the last remaining player !

To understand how I built the algorithm, here is a diagram representing each step of the game.
